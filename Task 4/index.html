                <h1>About</h1>
                <p class="center">Virat Kohli is an Indian international cricketer who 
                    currently plays Test cricket and ODI cricket for India. 
                    Kohli is a former T20I player and a former captain of 
                    the Indian national cricket team. He is a right-handed 
                    batsman and an occasional unorthodox right arm quick bowler.
                    He currently represents Royal Challengers Bengaluru in the IPL 
                    and Delhi in domestic cricket. He holds the record as the highest 
                    run-scorer in IPL, ranks third in T20I, third in ODI, and stands as 
                    the fourth-highest in international cricket.[4] He also holds the record 
                    for scoring the most centuries in ODI cricket and stands second in the 
                    list of most international centuries scored. Hence, Kohli is widely 
                    regarded as one of the greatest batsmen of all time and the modern era. 
                    Kohli was a key member of the Indian team that won the 2011 Cricket World 
                    Cup, 2013 Champions Trophy and 2024 T20 World Cup and captained India to 
                    win the ICC Test mace three consecutive times in 2017, 2018, and 2019.</p>

                    <div class="para">
                        <p>In 2008, Kohli was approached by sports agent Bunty 
                           Sajdeh of Cornerstone Sport and Entertainment after 
                           his notable performance in the ICC Under-19 World Cup. 
                           Sajdeh was impressed with Kohli's leadership skills 
                           and attitude and saw great potential in the young 
                           cricketer. After being recommended by Yuvraj Singh, 
                           Kohli was signed to Cornerstone Sport and Entertainment.
                           Over the years, Kohli's brand endorsement portfolio has 
                           experienced significant growth. In 2013, it was reported 
                           that his endorsements were valued at over ₹1 billion (US$12 million).
                           Now in 2023, his brand value has reached ₹1,000 crore (US$120 million).
                           His bat deal with MRF is regarded as one of the most financially rewarding 
                           deals in cricket history.In 2017, Kohli entered into a notable 
                           endorsement agreement with Puma that spanned over eight years and was 
                           estimated to be worth around ₹1.1 billion (US$13 million). This deal made 
                           Kohli the first Indian athlete to sign a brand endorsement contract valued 
                           at ₹100 crore (equivalent to ₹140 crore or US$17 million in 2023) deal with 
                           a brand.As of January 2023, Kohli is widely regarded as the most marketable 
                           cricketer, with annual earnings estimated at ₹165 crore (equivalent to ₹175 
                           crore or US$21 million in 2023).Kohli is currently recognized as the most 
                           followed Asian individual on the social media platform Instagram, boasting 
                           over 266 million followers on the platform. Reports indicate that he is able 
                           to command a fee of ₹8.9 crore (equivalent to ₹9.4 crore or US$1.1 million in 
                           2023) for each sponsored post on the platform.</p>
                           <p>
                            Kohli has gained international acclaim for his athletic achievements and widespread 
                            popularity, earning a prominent place among the world's most renowned athletes, as 
                            per ESPN.In 2014, American Appraisal conducted an evaluation of Kohli's 
                            brand value and determined it to be $56.4 million, placing him fourth on the list of 
                            India's most valued celebrity brands.The following two years saw Kohli's brand 
                            value soar higher. As per a report published in October 2016 by Duff & Phelps, 
                            Kohli's brand worth had increased to $92 million, second only to that of Bollywood 
                            actor Shah Rukh Khan.In 2017, Kohli was recognized by Forbes as the seventh 
                            "Most Valuable Brand among Athletes", surpassing renowned sports figures such as 
                            Lionel Messi, Rory McIlroy, and Stephen Curry, with a brand estimation of $14.5 
                            million.By September of the same year, Kohli had amassed endorsement agreements 
                            with 17 distinct brands, and he announced that he would only endorse products that 
                            he personally uses and believes in.The following year, he was featured on 
                            Time magazine's annual list of the 100 most influential people in the world.
                            In 2019, Kohli was the only cricketer included in Forbes' list of "World's 
                            100 Highest-Paid Athletes". He was ranked 100th on the list, with earnings estimated 
                            at $25 million, with $21 million being procured through endorsements, and the remainder
                            from salary and tournament winnings.Furthermore, in March 2019, Kohli was named 
                            the brand ambassador of the mobile esports platform, Mobile Premier League.Kohli's 
                            earning potential continued to climb, and in 2020, he attained the 66th spot in Forbes 
                            compilation of the top 100 highest-paid athletes in the world for the year 2020, with 
                            estimated earnings exceeding $26 million.In April 2021, Vivo appointed Kohli as 
                            their brand ambassador ahead of the Indian Premier League.
                           </p>
                           <p>In 2012, Kohli was recognized as one of the best-dressed men by the fashion magazine 
                            GQ, appearing on their annual list alongside prominent figures such as Barack Obama.
                            Six years later, in 2018, a documentary highlighting Kohli's cricketing career was 
                            released on National Geographic channel. The film aimed to celebrate his accomplishments 
                            in the sport.The following year, on the eve of the 2019 Cricket World Cup a tribute 
                            was bestowed upon Kohli. Madame Tussauds renowned for their lifelike wax figures, unveiled 
                            an exquisite creation of Kohli in London.Continuing the string of accolades, in 2019, 
                            on the eleventh anniversary of his international debut, Kohli was honoured with a stand named 
                            after him at the Feroz Shah Kotla Stadium in Delhi, making him the youngest cricketer to 
                            receive such a recognition.In November of the same year, an Indian animated superhero 
                            television series entitled Super V premiered, featuring a fictionalized portrayal of Kohli's 
                            teenage years and his discovery of superpowers.</p>

                    <h1>Here's a time line of Virat Kohli's life:</h1>
                    <hr>
                    <ul>
                      <li><strong>2002</strong> - In October, 13-year-old Virat is called up to the Delhi Under-15 team for the Polly Umrigar Trophy. He finishes the season as Delhi’s top scorer.</li>
                      <li><strong>2006</strong> - After impressing at the youth level for Delhi, Virat is selected for the India Under-19 team for the first time and has a glorious tour of England, averaging over a hundred in the one-day series.</li>
                      <li><strong>2008</strong> - Virat captained India to victory in the Under-19 World Cup in Malaysia, finishing the tournament as one of the top three run-getters. His natural leadership skills caught the attention of all the right people.</li>
                      <li><strong>2008(June)</strong> - Still a teenager, Virat is signed by IPL franchise Royal Challengers Bangalore on a youth contract for just Rs 12.5 lakhs.</li>
                      <li><strong>2008(August)</strong> - Virat was called up to the Indian ODI squad for the first time, playing all 5 matches in an away series against Sri Lanka. He scored his first half-century, an innings of 54, in game 4 of the series.</li>
                      <li><strong>2009</strong> - Virat had to wait a while to get back into the national team, but it was worth it when he scored his maiden ODI century against Sri Lanka, 107 off 111 </li>
                      <li><strong>2011</strong> - Virat played every single match of India’s successful 2011 World Cup campaign, making his only century in the first game of the tournament against Bangladesh. Though he didn’t really light up the tournament with his bat, his quote about Sachin at the end of the tournament has gone down in cricketing folklore: “Sachin Tendulkar has carried the burden of the nation for 21 years. It is time we carried him on our shoulders.”</li>
                      <li><strong>2011</strong> - Ask any cricketer what their aspiration is, and they will universally say play Test cricket. Virat finally got the chance to make his Test debut in 2011 against the West Indies, and unfortunately for the charismatic youngster, it was a far-from-memorable occasion, making a grand total of 19 runs in the two innings he played.</li>
                      <li><strong>2012</strong> - Kohli scored his first test hundred in rather spectacular circumstances in the fourth and final test against Australia at Adelaide, narrowly surviving getting run out when batting with Ishant Sharma, almost running out of partners as well. His effort though failed to save India. We lost the series 4-0.</li>
                      <li><strong>2012</strong> - Virat played what is arguably one of the best ODI innings ever by an Indian batsmen smashing 133 not out against Sri Lanka off just 86 balls to guide India to the final of CB Series in Australia. India were chasing 321 and got to the target in 37 overs as Hobart witnessed one of the greatest batting displays ever.</li>
                      <li><strong>2013</strong> - Virat was named stand-in ODI skipper for an injured MS Dhoni when India toured the West Indies; earlier that year, he had also been appointed captain of his IPL franchise, the Royal Challengers Bangalore.</li>
                      <li><strong>2014</strong> - Kohli got his first taste of Test captaincy when he was once again asked to step in for an injured MS in Australia, and celebrated by scoring a century in both innings in Adelaide. In what was a memorable </li>
                      <li><strong>2015</strong> - Having become a co-owner in ISL football club FC Goa the previous year, Kohli extended his interest to tennis by also picking up stake in the IPTL franchise, UAE Royals.</li>
                      <li><strong>2016</strong> - He played what was easily the best innings of his burgeoning career as India beat Australia in Mohali to advance to the semi-finals of the ICC World T20. His 82 off 51 balls was a classy effort, etched with timing and precision as opposed to the lappa style of cricket one usually associates with 20 over cricket.</li>
